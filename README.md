This is a sample app in response to this Stack Overflow question:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69699722/how-do-assign-a-type-of-file-to-my-app-on-mac/69714121

It shows the minimal code that allows an application to open a particular file type using the `-application:openFile` `<NSApplicationDelegate>` method.
